# PersonalKanjiDictionaryApp
An app for learning one of japanese alphabets: KANJI

KANJI is Japanese character alphabet that taken from China before making their own. Now, even they have their own characters, Japanese people still use 3000-4000 KANJI characters in daily life. Almost every KANJI has ONYOMI (Chinese reading) and KUNYOMI (Japanese reading).
Learning Kanji is always a problem for both Japanese people and foreigners. We are also trying to learn Japanese and that’s why we want to design a great software as Kanji dictionary. 

A single KANJI character can be read as different sounds in different words:
花火 (はなび - hanabi) => flower + fire => fireworks
火山 (かざん - kazan) => fire + mountain => volcano

Thats why we need KANJİ dictionaries. If we know how the word sounds, we can directly search for it as in Turkish or English dictionaries. It works the same for searching with the English meaning, for finding related Kanji.  
But if we see the 火 character in a book and don’t know how to read it; it’s only a combination of strokes! And as solution we can filter all 4 stroke characters to find the one we’re looking for.
In application, users will login with their ID and passwords. Because users have their own Kanji characters in their accounts, they can search for every word they saved before. When users learn a new Kanji, they can add to their dictionay. Also they have authority to modify or delete an existing Kanji.

Don't forget to add DB.json file in "KanjiDictionaryApp >> Bin >> Debug" file path!
For an initial example database you can copy the following line into your .json file WITH YOUR OWN PATH, MAIL and PASSWORD:
